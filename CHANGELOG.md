## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed

- **Completion message display**: Fixed cursor positioning for success/error messages
  - Messages now display cleanly at the beginning of a new line
  - Affects all three commands: ripple, worm, and twirl
  - Resolves issue where completion messages appeared mid-line after animation ended
  - Improved professional appearance of CLI output

### Technical

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added

- **--ends flag for all commands**: New universal option to add start/end characters around animations
  - Accepts even-length strings split in half for start and end characters
  - Works across all three commands: ripple, worm, and twirl
  - Examples: `--ends "[]"` ‚Üí `[animation]`, `--ends "<<>>"` ‚Üí `<<animation>>`
  - Multi-byte character support for emojis: `--ends "üéØüé™"` ‚Üí `üéØanimationüé™`
  - Graceful fallback for invalid input (odd-length strings)

- **Comprehensive test coverage for new features**: Added extensive test suites
  - Direction control tests: Forward-only vs bidirectional animation behavior
  - Custom style tests: ASCII, Unicode, emoji, and mixed character pattern validation
  - CLI integration tests: End-to-end testing for all new command-line options
  - Ends functionality tests: Multi-byte character handling, error cases, help documentation
  - Total: 58 new test examples covering all edge cases

- **Worm direction control**: Fine-grained animation movement control
  - `--direction forward` (or `-d f`): Animation moves only forward, resets at end
  - `--direction bidirectional` (or `-d b`): Default back-and-forth movement
  - Compatible with all worm styles including custom patterns

- **Worm custom styles**: User-defined 3-character animation patterns
  - Format: `--style custom=abc` where `abc` defines baseline, midline, peak characters
  - ASCII support: `--style custom=_-=` ‚Üí `___-=___`
  - Unicode support: `--style custom=‚ñ´‚ñ™‚ñ†` ‚Üí geometric patterns
  - Emoji support: `--style custom=üü¶üü®üü•` ‚Üí colorful animations
  - Mixed characters: `--style custom=.üü°*` ‚Üí combined ASCII and emoji
  - Proper multi-byte character counting for accurate 3-character validation

### Enhanced

- **Centralized utility functions**: Moved common functionality to `RubyProgress::Utils`
  - `Utils.parse_ends()`: Universal start/end character parsing

  - New common options section highlighting universal flags
  - Detailed --ends usage examples with various character patterns
  - Enhanced help output for all commands

### Technical

- **Version management**: Bumped all component versions to reflect new features
  - Main version: 1.1.9 ‚Üí 1.2.0 (new feature addition)
  - Worm version: 1.0.4 ‚Üí 1.1.0 (direction control + custom styles)
  - Ripple version: 1.0.5 ‚Üí 1.1.0 (ends support)
  - Twirl version: 1.0.1 ‚Üí 1.1.0 (ends support)

## [1.1.9] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed

- **Worm animation line clearing**: Resolved issue where completion messages appeared alongside animation characters
  - Fixed stream mismatch where animations used stderr but completion messages used stdout
  - Implemented atomic operation combining line clearing and message output on stderr
  - Ensured clean line clearing for all scenarios (success, error, no completion message)
  - Updated tests to match new stderr-based completion message output
  - Clean output format: animation disappears completely before completion message appears

### Technical

- **Stream consistency**: All worm animation output (including completion messages) now uses stderr consistently
- **Enhanced completion message display**: Single atomic stderr operation prevents race conditions between line clearing and message display

## [1.1.8] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- **Intelligent fuzzy matching for twirl styles**: Enhanced twirl style selector with sophisticated pattern matching
  - Exact matches: Direct style name matching (case-insensitive)
  - Prefix matches: `ar` matches `arc` instead of `arrow` (shortest match priority)
  - Character-by-character fuzzy matches: `cls` matches `classic` (sequential character matching)
  - Substring fallback: Comprehensive matching for partial inputs
  - Works dynamically against all available indicator styles in `RubyProgress::INDICATORS`

### Improved

- **Worm message spacing**: Enhanced visual formatting for worm animations
  - Automatic space insertion between `--message` text and animation
  - Clean formatting: `"Loading data ‚óè¬∑¬∑‚óè¬∑"` instead of `"Loading data‚óè¬∑¬∑‚óè¬∑"`
  - No extra spacing when no message is provided
  - Consistent behavior across all worm animation methods (standard, daemon, aggressive clearing)

### Technical

- **Enhanced test coverage**: Added comprehensive fuzzy matching test suite for twirl styles
  - 13 test cases covering exact, prefix, fuzzy, and edge case scenarios
  - Validation of shortest match priority and character-order matching
  - Integration with existing comprehensive test coverage (maintained at 70.47%)

## [1.1.7] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- **Visual style previews**: Added `--show-styles` flag to all subcommands showing visual previews of animation styles
  - Global `prg --show-styles` displays all styles for all subcommands with visual examples
  - Subcommand-specific `prg <subcommand> --show-styles` shows only relevant styles
  - Ripple styles show "Progress" text with actual color/effect rendering
  - Worm styles display wave patterns like `¬∑¬∑‚óè‚¨§‚óè¬∑¬∑` for circles style
  - Twirl styles show spinner character sequences like `‚óú ‚ó† ‚óù ‚óû ‚ó° ‚óü` for arc style
- **Process management**: Added `--stop-all` flag for comprehensive process control
  - Global `prg --stop-all` stops all prg processes across all subcommands
  - Subcommand-specific `prg <subcommand> --stop-all` stops only processes for that animation type
  - Smart process detection excludes current process to prevent self-termination
  - Graceful termination using TERM signal for proper cleanup

### Improved

- **Error handling**: Replaced verbose Ruby stack traces with clean, user-friendly error messages
  - Invalid command-line options now show simple "Invalid option: --flag-name" messages
  - Each error includes appropriate usage information and help guidance
  - Consistent error format across all subcommands (ripple, worm, twirl)
- **Style discovery**: Enhanced distinction between `--list-styles` (simple name lists) and `--show-styles` (visual previews)
- **Silent process management**: All `--stop` and `--stop-all` commands now operate silently
  - No status messages or confirmation output for cleaner automation
  - Exit code 0 when processes found and stopped successfully
  - Exit code 1 when no processes found to stop
- **Terminal output separation**: Moved all animations to stderr for proper stream handling
  - Animations and progress indicators use stderr (status information)
  - Application output remains on stdout (program data)
  - Fixes daemon mode output interruption issues
- **Enhanced process cleanup**: Improved daemon process termination reliability
  - Uses TERM signal first for graceful shutdown, followed by KILL if needed
  - Comprehensive process detection and cleanup across all subcommands
  - Better handling of orphaned processes

  - Added comprehensive error handling tests
  - Enhanced daemon lifecycle testing
  - Improved edge case coverage for all animation types
  - Added version constant validation tests

## [1.1.4] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed

- **Development environment**: Fixed `bin/prg` to use local library files instead of installed gem versions during development

## [1.1.3] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed

- **Twirl spinner animation**: Fixed spinner freezing during command execution by ensuring continuous animation loop
- **Default message behavior**: Removed default "Processing" message when no `--message` is provided - now shows only spinner
- **Daemon termination output**: Removed verbose "Stop signal sent to process" message for cleaner daemon workflows

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed

- **Critical gem execution issue**: Fixed installed gem binaries not executing due to `__FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME` check failing when paths differ between gem binary location and RubyGems wrapper script

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-09

### Added

- **New Twirl subcommand**: Extracted spinner functionality into dedicated `prg twirl` subcommand with 35+ spinner styles

- **Simplified daemon control**: Added `--stop-id NAME` and `--status-id NAME` for controlling named daemons
- **Automatic flag implications**: `--stop-success`, `--stop-error`, and `--stop-id` now automatically imply `--stop`
- **Global style listing**: Added `prg --list-styles` to show all available styles across all subcommands
- **Unified style system**: Replaced ripple's `--rainbow` and `--inverse` flags with `--style` argument supporting `--style rainbow,inverse`
- **Integrated case transformation**: Converted `--caps` flag to `--style caps` for consistent style system, supports combinations like `--style caps,inverse`

### Changed

- **Refactored CLI architecture**: Three-subcommand structure (ripple, worm, twirl) with consistent daemon management
